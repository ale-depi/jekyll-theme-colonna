* Keep love in your heart. A life without it is like a sunless garden when the
  flowers are dead. The consciousness of loving and being loved brings warmth
  and richness to life that nothing else can bring.
  + *Quoted by Alvin Redman in The Epigrams of Oscar Wilde (1952)*
* He is really not so ugly after all, provided, of course, that one shuts one's
  eyes, and does not look at him.
  + *"The Birthday of the Infanta", The House of Pomegranates (1892)*
* The old believe everything; the middle-aged suspect everything; the young
  know everything.
  + *Phrases and Philosophies for the Use of the Young (1894)*
